<h2>Laboratory: Buffered versus unbuffered I/O</h2>

<p>As usual, keep a log in the file <samp>lab.txt</samp> of what you
do in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>For this laboratory, you will implement transliteration
programs <samp>tr2b</samp> and <samp>tr2u</samp> that use buffered and
unbuffered I/O respectively, and compare the resulting implementations
and performance. Each implementation should be a main program that
takes two operands <var>from</var> and <var>to</var> that are byte
strings of the same length, and that copies standard input to standard
output, transliterating every byte in <var>from</var> to the
corresponding byte in <var>to</var>. Your implementations should
report an error <var>from</var> and <var>to</var> are not the same
length, or if <var>from</var> has duplicate bytes.  To summarize, your
implementations should like the standard utility
<samp><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/tr.html">tr</a></samp>
does, except that they have no options, characters
like <samp>[</samp>, <samp>-</samp> and <samp>\</samp> have no special
meaning in the operands, operand errors must be diagnosed, and your
implementations act on bytes rather than on (possibly multibyte)
characters.</p>

<ol>

<li>Write a C transliteration program <samp>tr2b.c</samp> that
uses <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getchar.html"><samp>getchar</samp></a>
and <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/putchar.html"><samp>putchar</samp></a>
to transliterate bytes as described above.</li>

<li>Write a C program <samp>tr2u.c</samp> that uses <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/read.html"><samp>read</samp></a>
and <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/write.html"><samp>write</samp></a>
to transliterate bytes, instead of using <samp>getchar</samp> and
<samp>putchar</samp>. The <var>nbyte</var> arguments to
<samp>read</samp> and <samp>write</samp> should be 1, so that the
program reads and writes single bytes at a time.</li>

<li>Use the <samp>strace</samp> command to compare the system calls
issued by your <samp>tr2b</samp> and <samp>tr2u</samp> commands (a)
when copying one file to another, and (b) when copying a file to your
terminal. Use a file that contains at least 5,000,000 bytes.</li>

<li>Use the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/time.html"><samp>time</samp></a>
command to measure how much faster one program is, compared to the
other, when copying the same amount of data.</li>

<h2>Homework: Encrypted sort revisited</h2>

<p>Rewrite the <samp>sfrob</samp> program you wrote previously
so that it uses system calls rather than <samp>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</samp>
to read standard input and write standard output.
Your program should use a small number of <samp>read</samp>
system calls, ordinarily by determining the input file's size when possible
and allocating a buffer that is slightly larger than that size.
If the input's size cannot easily be determined
(for example, because the input is a pipe), your program can
start with a small buffer size of
8&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte">KiB</a>.
Either way, your program should repeatedly append data to the buffer
by reading the data (passing the largest count to <samp>read</samp>
that cannot
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">overrun the buffer</a>)
until <samp>read</samp> reports an error or end-of-file;
if the buffer fills up, your program should reallocate the buffer to
be twice as large as it was before and then resume reading.
Assuming enough memory exists this approach should work even if the
input file grows while your program is reading it, which is something
that you should be able to test.</p>

<p>When debugging, you may find the
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer
(asan)</a> and the
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/16/gcc-undefined-behavior-sanitizer-ubsan/">Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (ubsan)</a>
useful; these can be enabled with the GCC
options <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html"><samp>-fsanitize=address</samp> and <samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp></a>,
respectively.</p>

<p>Your program should do one thing in addition to <samp>sfrob</samp>.
If given the <samp>-f</samp> option, your program should
ignore case while sorting, by using the standard <samp><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/toupper.html">toupper</a></samp>
function to upper-case each byte after decrypting and before comparing
the byte. You can assume that each input byte represents a separate
character; that is, you need not worry about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-width_encoding">multi-byte
encodings</a>. As noted in its specification, <samp>toupper</samp>'s
argument should be either <samp>EOF</samp> or a nonnegative value
that is at most <samp>UCHAR_MAX</samp> (as defined in <samp><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">&lt;limits.h&gt;</a></samp>);
hence one cannot simply pass a <samp>char</samp> value to
<samp>toupper</samp>, as <samp>char</samp> is in the
range <samp>CHAR_MIN</samp>..<samp>CHAR_MAX</samp>.</p>

<p>Call the rewritten program
<samp>sfrobu</samp>. Measure any differences in performance between
<samp>sfrob</samp> and <samp>sfrobu</samp> using the
<samp>time</samp> command. Run your program on inputs of varying
numbers of input lines (say zero, 100, 10,000, and a million lines),
and estimate the CPU time cost as a
function of the number of input lines.</p>

<p>Also, suppose the assignment were changed so that the rewritten
program also had to use system calls rather
than <samp>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</samp> memory allocation functions such
as <samp>malloc</samp>, <samp>realloc</samp><samp>free</samp>. Which
system calls would the program use, and what would the calls'
arguments look like? Use <samp>strace</samp> on
your <samp>sfrobu</samp> runs on inputs of varying size, to deduce
what system calls <samp>sfrobu</samp> uses to allocate memory (or to
reallocate memory if the input file grows while <samp>sfrobu</samp> is
running).</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit
the following files separately (not in a tarball):</p>

<ul>

<li>The files <samp>tr2b.c</samp> and
  <samp>tr2u.c</samp> as described in the lab</li>

<li>A single source file <samp>sfrobu.c</samp> as described in the
homework.</li>

<li>A text file <samp>report.txt</samp> containing a copy of
your <samp>lab.txt</samp> file, followed by the results of
your sfrob performance comparison and a description of your
memory-allocation system call analysis as described in the homework.</li>

</ul>

<p>All files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns, and with no more than 200 columns per line.
The C source file should contain no more than 132 columns per line.
The shell
commands</p>

<pre><samp>expand report.txt |
  awk '/\r/ || 200 &lt; length'
expand tr2b.c tr2u.c sfrobu.c |
  awk '/\r/ || 132 &lt; length'
</samp></pre>

<p>should output nothing.</p>
