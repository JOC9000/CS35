<h2>Laboratory: Git spelunking</h2>

<p>Consider the Git repository and working files in the directory
  <samp>~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L</samp> on the SEASnet GNU/Linux hosts.
  For this repository, answer the following questions, using Git
  commands and/or scripts of your own devising. For each question,
  record which commands you used; if you wrote and used a script,
  include a copy of the script.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How much disk space is used to represent the working files in
    this directory? How much is used to represent the Git repository?
    What file or files consume most of the repository space and
    why?</li>

  <li>How many branches are local to the repository? How many are remote?</li>

  <li>How many repositories are remote to this repository,
    and where are they?</li>

  <li>What are the ten local branches most recently committed to? List
    their names in order of commit date, most recent first.</li>

  <li>How many commits are in the master branch?</li>

  <li>What percentage of the commits that are in any branch, are also
    in the master branch?</li>

  <li>Which ten people authored the most master-branch commits
    that were committed in the year 2013 or later, and how
    many commits did each of them author during that period?</li>

  <li>Use the <samp>gitk</samp> command to visualize the commit graph
    in this repository. If you are SSHing into SEASnet, you’ll need to
    log in via <samp>ssh -X</samp> or (less securely) <samp>ssh
    -Y</samp>.  Draw a diagram relating the following commits to each
    other. You need not list every single
    intervening commit individually; you can simply
    use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis">ellipses</a>.

    <pre><samp>        4ea37c2b8b0c5a68fde59770c3536195e0972217
	977cd6cb28a37744966ec62f70cf62659f6f302a
	625cee531623feddbe3174fad52c7db96ec60bb3

	98ac36efe4ce4bd3a0bca76fc73ce6c7abaa4371</samp></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As usual, keep a log in the file <samp>lab9.txt</samp> of what you
do in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened. Your lab note should contain the abovementioned
record of the scripts you used.</p>

  <h2>Homework: Topologically ordered commits</h2>

  <p>
    Given a git repository, the commits can be thought of as having
    the structure of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the commits
    being the vertices. In particular, one can create a directed edge
    from each child commit to each of its parent
    commits. Alternatively, one can create a directed edge from each
    parent to each of its children. Note that if a commit is a merge
    commit, it will have two or even more parents. In that case, one has to
    consider all parents.
  </p>

  <p>
    Follow these five steps and implement <code>topo_order_commits.py</code>
    using <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/python3</code> on the SEASnet GNU/Linux
    servers.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>Discover the <samp>.git</samp> directory.</em> Inside a directory,
      when the script <samp>topo_order_commits.py</samp> (which
      doesn’t have to reside in the same directory) is invoked, the
      script should first determine where the top level Git directory
      is. The top level Git directory is the one containing
      the <samp>.git</samp> directory. One can do this by looking
      for <samp>.git</samp> in the current directory, and if it
      doesn’t exist search the parent directory, etc.
      This discovery process should only go up, and never descend into
      a child directory.  Output a diagnostic
      ‘<samp>Not inside a Git repository</samp>’ to standard error
      and exit with status 1
      if <samp>.git</samp> cannot be found when the search went all
      the way to the <samp>/</samp> directory.
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Get the list of local branch names.</em>
      Figure out what the different directories inside <samp>.git</samp>
      do, particularly the refs and objects directories.
      Beware of branch names with forward slashes. Read
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">§10.2 Git Internals – Git Objects</a> and
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References">§10.3
      Git Internals – Git References</a>. One can use
      the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html"><samp>zlib</samp>
	library in Python</a> to decompress Git objects.
      To simplify this assignment, you can assume that the repository
      does not use packfiles (see
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">§10.4
      Git Internals – Packfiles</a>), i.e., that all its
      objects are loose.
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Build the commit graph.</em> Each commit can be represented as an
      instance of the CommitNode class, which you can define as follows,
      and which you are also free to modify or not use at all:
      <pre><samp>class CommitNode:
    def __init__(self, commit_hash):
        """
        :type commit_hash: str
        """
        self.commit_hash = commit_hash
        self.parents = set()
        self.children = set()
      </samp></pre>
      <p>
      The commit graph consists of all the commit nodes from
      all the branches. Each commit node might have multiple
      parents and children.
      </p>
      <p>
	In particular, for each branch, perform a depth-first search
	traversal starting from the branch head (i.e., the commit
	pointed to by the branch), to establish the parent-child
	relationships between the commit nodes. The traversal should
	trace through the parents, and for every possible pair of
	parent and child, add the child hash to the parent node's
	children, and add the parent hash to the child node's
	parents. The leaf nodes for each branch will be the root
	commits for that branch, where the leaf nodes are the nodes
	without any parents. Let <samp>root_commits</samp> be the
	union of all the leaf nodes across all the branches. If a
	commit is not reachable from any of the branch heads, it
	should not be part of the commit graph.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
     <em>Generate a topological
     ordering of the commits in the graph.</em> A topological ordering for our
     case would be a total ordering of the commit nodes such that all the
     descendent commit nodes are strictly less than the ancestral commits,
     where nodes in <samp>root_commits</samp> are
     the oldest ancestors.  One way to generate a
     topological ordering is to use a depth-first
     search; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">Topological sorting</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	<em>Print the commit
	hashes in the order generated by the previous step,
	from the least to the greatest.</em>
	If the next commit to be printed is not the
	parent of the current commit, insert a “sticky end” followed
	by an empty line before printing the next commit. The “sticky
	end” will contain the commit hashes of the parents of the current
	commit, with an equal sign “<samp>=</samp>” appended to the last hash.
	These hashes of the parents, if any, can be printed in any order
	separated by whitespace. If there are no parents,
	just print an equal sign, “<samp>=</samp>”.
	This is to
	inform us how the fragments can be “glued”
	together.
      </p>
      <p>
	On the other hand, if an empty line has just been printed,
	before printing the first commit C in a new segment, print a
	“sticky start” line starting with an equal sign,
	“<samp>=</samp>”, followed by the hashes of the children of C,
	if any, on the same line in any order and separated by
	whitespace, so that we know which commits led to commit
	C. There is no whitespace after the equal sign.
      </p>
      <p>
	Furthermore, if a commit corresponds to a branch head
	or heads, the branch names should be listed after the commit in
	lexicographical order, separated by white space.
	Note that this rule does not apply to the hashes in the sticky
	starts or sticky ends.
      </p>
      <p>
	The commit hashes in the sticky starts and sticky ends are not
	considered as part of the sequence of topologically ordered
	commit output. They are printed only as a visual guide. So
	even if a commit hash has already appeared in a sticky start
	or sticky end, it still must be printed as part of the
	normal sequence of topologically ordered commit output.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  <em>Example 1.</em> Consider the following commits
where c3 is a child of c1, and c5 is a child of c4:
  </p>

  <pre><samp>  c0 -&gt; c1 -&gt; c2 (branch-1)
         \
          c3 -&gt; c4 (branch-2, branch-5)
                 \
                  c5 (branch-3)</samp></pre>

  <p>
    A valid topological ordering from the least to the greatest will
    be (c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, c0) which should give the following output
    (assuming the commit hash for cX is hX, and the triple grave
    accents (<samp>```</samp>) are not part of the output but merely
    indicate the start and end of the output lines):
  </p>

  <pre><samp>  ```
  h5 branch-3
  h4 branch-2 branch-5
  h3
  h1=

  =
  h2 branch-1
  h1
  h0
  ```</samp></pre>

  <p>
    A equally valid
    topological ordering from the least to the greates will be
    (c2, c5, c4, c3, c1, c0), which should
    give the following output:
  </p>

  <pre><samp>  ```
  h2 branch-1
  h1=

  =
  h5 branch-3
  h4 branch-2 branch-5
  h3
  h1
  h0
  ```</samp></pre>

  <p><em>Example 2.</em> For the following commits where c6 is a
    merge commit with parents c2 and c4:

</p><pre><samp>  c0 -&gt; c1 -&gt; c2 -&gt; c6 (branch-1)
	 \         /
	  c3 -&gt; c4</samp></pre>

A topological ordering is (c6, c2, c4, c3, c1, c0), and the
corresponding output should be:

<pre><samp>  ```
  h6 branch-1
  h2
  h1=

  =h6
  h4
  h3
  h1
  h0
  ```</samp></pre>

  <p>
    <em>Implementation notes.</em>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Do not invoke any Git commands in any way. For example, do not
      use Python subprocesses to call Git.
    </li>

    <li>
      The output of <samp>topo_order_commits.py</samp> should be
      deterministic. For a given Git repository, even though there
      might be multiple possible ways to perform DFS, multiple valid
      topological orderings and multiple valid outputs, different
      invocations of <samp>topo_order_commits.py</samp> should produce
      identical outputs. For example, since the iteration order on a
      set <samp>s</samp> in Python is not deterministic, one way to
      ensure determinism is to call <samp>sorted(s)</samp> which will
      give a sorted list.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use only the modules in the Python Standard Library. In fact,
      <samp>os</samp>, <samp>sys</samp>, and <samp>zlib</samp> are the
      only libraries you need.
    </li>

    <li>
      Points might be deducted if the naming of local variables and
      functions are not
      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">snake
      case</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>


  <p>
    <em>Testing.</em>  Please
    use <a href="https://github.com/Rustinante/topo-ordered-commits-test-suite">our
    test suite</a> to make sure you are on the right
    track. The <samp>README</samp> file contains instructions on how
    to use it. Note that passing all the test cases in the test suite
    does not guarantee a completely correct implementation.
