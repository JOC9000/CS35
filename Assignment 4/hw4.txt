1. I do not know how to answer this question yet fully yet
   but I suspect that that it would improve the performance
   since the overhead of an if is no longer present with 
   the invocation of the -A option in the patched ls.
   After running time tests, I see that my theory seems to 
   hold true, using the options -RaA with both on /usr on
   the servers, I was able to see that the patched version
   edged out in speed by tenths of a second. Of course, 
   differing amounts on the servers at times could be
   causing my results.

2. Several problems could stem from the patch. Any script 
   that implements the patch and relies on the amount of files
   displayed before, with the incorrect behavior, would change
   their behavior and could produce vastly different results.

3. When randline.py is invoked on an empty file, it raises an
   error, citing that the implementation of the random module
   of python of 2.7 raises an IndexError when a list is empty.
   This is because a list with no entries cannot be indexed,
   and the list contains the lines of the empty file. Since 
   the file has no lines, the resultant list is empty, and
   cannot be indexed to be randomized.

4. When randline.py is invoked with python3, an error is
   thrown, citing line 65 as the location of the error. I 
   assume this is due to some part of the exception on line
   65 using a method deprecated or changed in python3.

5. After testing my shuf.py and using it on the autograder,
   getting full points, I began to test it with python 2,
   and in all my test cases its behavior was consistent 
   and correct. Therefore my shuf.py seems to act the
   same with python 2 and 3. I assume this is because the 
   methods and modules I used are all usable in python 2
   and 3.
