<p>You’re helping to develop an operating system and command set that
as part of its acceptance test is supposed to be used by a large
government agency. The agency has lots of requirements, some sensible
and some persnickety, and one of these requirements is that
applications must use characters properly from
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a>
character set. In particular, applications must use the Unicode
character “<samp>`</samp>” (grave
accent, <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/60/index.htm">U+0060</a>)
only as a spacing accent character.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of your
applications, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/">GNU
Diffutils</a>, regularly uses “<samp>`</samp>” as a quoting character
in diagnostics. For example, the command “<samp>diff
. -</samp>” outputs the diagnostic “<samp>diff: cannot
compare `-' to a directory</samp>”, and this misuse of
“<samp>`</samp>” violates your customer’s requirements. You need to
change Diffutils so that it outputs “<samp>diff: cannot compare
'-' to a directory</samp>” instead, using an apostrophe
(<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/27/index.htm">U+0027</a>)
for both opening and closing quote. You don’t want to use fancier
quoting characters such as “<samp>‘</samp>” and
“<samp>’</samp>” (left and right single quotation
marks, <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2018/index.htm">U+2018</a>
and <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2019/index.htm">U+2019</a>)
because they are
not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters
and another customer requirement is that the programs must work in
ASCII-only environments.</p>

<p>The good news is that the Diffutils maintainers have run into a
similar problem, and have a patch called “maint: quote 'like
this' or "like this", not `like this'” that does what you
want. The bad news is that your customer has
specified Diffutils version 3.0, and the patch that you want
is not in version 3.0. Also, your customer is conservative and
wants a minimal patch so that it’s easy to audit, whereas the
Diffutils maintainers’ patch also affects commentary and documentation
which your customer doesn’t need or want changed.</p>

<h2>Laboratory: Managing a backported change</h2>

<p>As usual, keep a log in the file <samp>lab8.txt</samp> of what you
do in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<ol>

<li>Get a copy of the Diffutils repository, in Git format,
from the file <samp>~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils</samp> on the
SEASnet GNU/Linux servers, or
from <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=diffutils">its main
Savannah repository</a>.</li>

<li>Get a log of changes to Diffutils’ master branch using the
“<samp>git log</samp>” command, and put it into the file
<samp>git-log.txt</samp>.</li>

<li>Generate a list of tags used for Diffutils using the
“<samp>git tag</samp>” command, and put it into the
file <samp>git-tags.txt</samp></li>

<li>Find the commit entitled “maint: quote 'like this' or "like
this", not `like this'”, and generate a patch for that commit,
putting it into the file <samp>quote-patch.txt</samp>.</li>

<li>Check out version 3.0 of Diffutils from your repository.</li>

<li>Use the <samp>patch</samp> command to
apply <samp>quote-patch.txt</samp> to version 3.0. In some cases it
will not be able to figure out what file to patch; skip past those by
typing RETURN. Record any problems you had in applying the patch.</li>

<li>Use the <samp>git status</samp> command to get an overview of what
happened.</li>

<li>Learn how to use the Emacs functions
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Old-Revisions.html"><samp>vc-diff</samp></a>
(<samp>C-x v =</samp>) and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/VC-Undo.html"><samp>vc-revert</samp></a>
(<samp>C-x v u</samp>). When you're in the <samp>*vc-diff*</samp>
buffer generated by <samp>vc-diff</samp>,
use <samp>describe-mode</samp> (<samp>C-h m</samp>) to find out the
Emacs functions that you can use there, and in particular learn how to use
the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diff-Mode.html"><samp>diff-apply-hunk</samp></a>
(<samp>C-c C-a</samp>) and
<samp>diff-goto-source</samp> (<samp>C-c C-c</samp>) functions.</li>

<li>Use Emacs to revert all the changes to files other than <samp>.c</samp>
files, since you want only changes to <samp>.c</samp> files. Also,
<strong>and don't forget this part</strong>,
undo all the changes to <samp>.c</samp> files other than changes to
character string constants, as the character-string changes are the
only changes that you want; this may require editing some files by
hand.</li>

<li>Use Emacs to examine the
files <samp>src/*.c.rej</samp> carefully, and copy rejected patches
into the corresponding <samp>.c</samp> files as needed.</li>

<li>Remove all untracked files that <samp>git status</samp> warns
you about, since you don’t plan on adding any files in your patch.</li>

<li>When you’re done with the above, <samp>git status</samp> should
report a half-dozen modified files, and <samp>git diff</samp> should
output a patch that is three or four hundred lines long. Put that
patch into a file <samp>quote-3.0-patch.txt</samp>.</li>

<li>Build the resulting modified version of Diffutils,
using the commands described in the file <samp>README-hacking</samp>,
skipping the part about <a href="http://cvs.nongnu.org/">CVS</a>; CVS
is obsolescent. (If you are building on <samp>lnxsrv07</samp>
or <samp>lnxsrv09</samp> or any other host that is using version 2.16
or later of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">GNU C Library</a>, you will need
to apply an <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff">additional patch</a>
after running <samp>./bootstrap</samp> and before running
<samp>./configure</samp>, because glibc 2.16 removed the obsolete and
dangerous <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/gets.html"><samp>gets</samp></a>
function declared by a Diffutils header.)
Verify that Diffutils does the right thing with the
“<samp>diff . -</samp>” scenario, as well as with
“<samp>diff --help</samp>”.</li>

<li>Do a sanity test using the modified version
of Diffutils that you just built, by using the
just-built <samp>diff</samp> to compare the source code of Diffutils
3.0 to the source code of your modified version. Put the former source
code into a directory <samp>diffutils-3.0</samp> and the latter source
code into a directory <samp>diffutils-3.0-patch</samp>, and run your
implementation of <samp>diff</samp> with the command
“<samp><var>D</var>/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch
&gt;quote-3.0-test.txt</samp>”,
where the <samp><var>D</var></samp> is the directory containing your
<samp>diff</samp> implementation.</li>

<li>Use <samp>diff</samp> to compare the contents
of <samp>quote-3.0-test.txt</samp> and
<samp>quote-3.0-patch.txt</samp>. Are the files identical? If not, are
the differences innocuous?</li>

<h2>Homework: Verifying and publishing a backported change</h2>

<p>You’re happy with the code that you wrote
in your lab, but now you’d like to publish this patch,
in a form similar to that presented in the original patch,
so that others can use it.</p>

<ol>

<li>Maintain a file <samp>hw8.txt</samp> that logs the actions you do in solving the homework. This is like your lab notebook <samp>lab8.txt</samp>, except it’s for the homework instead of the lab.</li>

<li>Check out version 3.0 of Diffutils from your repository,
into a new branch named “<samp>quote</samp>”.</li>

<li>Install your change into this new branch, by running
the <samp>patch</samp> command with your patch
<samp>quote-3.0-patch.txt</samp> as input.</li>

<li> Learn how to use the Emacs function
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Change-Log-Commands.html"><samp>add-change-log-entry-other-window</samp></a>
(<samp>C-x 4 a</samp>).</li>

<li>Use this Emacs function to compose an appropriate ChangeLog entry
for your patch, by adapting the change log from the original patch.</li>

<li>Commit your changes to the new branch, using the
ChangeLog entry as the commit message.</li>

<li>Use the command “<samp>git format-patch</samp>”
to generate a file <samp>formatted-patch.txt</samp>.
This patch should work
without having to fix things by hand afterwards.</li>

<li>Verify that your patch works, by cloning a new repository,
checking out the clone's version 3.0
into a new temporary branch <samp>patchery</samp>, applying the patch with
the command “<samp>git am</samp>”, and building the
resulting system, checking that it works with “<samp>make
check</samp>”.</li>

<li>Verify that your ChangeLog entry works, by running
the command “<samp>make distdir</samp>” and inspecting
the resulting <samp>diffutils*/ChangeLog</samp> file.</li>

<li>There is a copy of the
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs">GNU Emacs
git repository</a>'s master branch on SEASnet in the directory
<samp>~eggert/src/gnu/emacs</samp>. Run the command <samp>gitk</samp>
on it, and find the newest merge that is not newer than
2015-01-25. Briefly describe (in <samp>hw8.txt</samp>) your view of
the mergepoint, along with the roles of subwindows that you see.</li>

</ol>

<section>
<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit three files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file <samp>lab8.txt</samp> as described
    in the lab.</li>
  <li>The file <samp>hw8.txt</samp> as described in the homework.</li>
  <li>A compressed tarball <samp>hw8.tgz</samp> containing
the following files:

<ul>

<li>The files <samp>git-log.txt</samp>,
<samp>git-tags.txt</samp>, <samp>quote-patch.txt</samp>,
and <samp>quote-3.0-patch.txt</samp> as described in the lab.</li>

<li>The file
<samp>formatted-patch.txt</samp>
as described in the homework.</li>

</ul>
</li></ul>

<p>All <samp>.txt</samp> files should be ASCII text files, with no
carriage returns. You can create the tarball with the command:</p>

<pre><samp>tar czf hw8.tgz git-log.txt git-tags.txt \
  quote-patch.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt formatted-patch.txt
</samp></pre>

<p>Don't forget to submit <samp>lab8.txt</samp> and <samp>hw8.text</samp> in
  addition to submitting <samp>hw8.tgz</samp>.</p>
