<h1>Assignment 2. SSH setup and use in applications</h1>

<section>
<h2>Laboratory</h2>

<p>Most likely you’ll need to do this lab entirely on SEASnet,
  treating one of the SEASnet GNU/Linux hosts as if it were your
  personal machine, and treating the others hosts as remote
  servers. Alternatively, if you have a bunch of ssh-capable machines
  of your own, you can do the lab there. Either way, specify in your
  log which machines you used.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a> to establish
convenient logins, so you should use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent">ssh-agent</a>
on your host to manage authentication. That is, you should be able to
log out of a host (dropping all your connections to it),
then log back in, type your passphrase once to
<samp>ssh-agent</samp>, and then be able to use <samp>ssh</samp> to
connect to any of your other hosts, without typing any passwords
or passphrases.</p>

<p>You should also use port forwarding so that you can run a command
on a remote host that displays on your host. For example, you should
be able to log into a remote host, type the command
<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xeyes.1.html"><samp>xeyes</samp></a>,
and get a graphical window on your display.
You will need to use <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/35512/what-is-the-difference-between-ssh-y-trusted-x11-forwarding-and-ssh-x-u"><samp>ssh
-X</samp> and/or <samp>ssh -Y</samp></a> when you use port
forwarding.
</p>

<p>Finally, you should be able to do a multihop or “daisy-chain”
  connection conveniently.  For example, you should be able
  to <samp>ssh</samp> into <samp>lnxsrv07</samp>, and then
  from <samp>lnxsrv07</samp> to <samp>lnxsrv09</samp>, and so on. You
  want these daisy chains to be convenient as possible. On SEASnet
  this is merely an exercise, since you can connect to any one of
  the <samp>lnxsrv*</samp> hosts as well as any of the others; but in
  the real world these sorts of connections are useful when for
  security reasons one cannot connect to an inner server
  directly. Investigate <a href="http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/articles/transparent-mulithop.html">Transparent
  Multi-hop SSH</a> and see which technique works best for you.</p>

<p>Keep a log of every step you personally took during the laboratory
to configure your or your team members' hosts, and what the results of
the step were. The idea behind recording your steps is that you should
be able to reproduce your work later, if need be.</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>On the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers,
use <a href="http://gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a>'s shell
commands to create a key pair. Use GPG version 2.
Export the public key, in ASCII format, into
a file <samp>hw-pubkey.asc</samp>. Use this key to create a detached
signature for your submission so that the commands described below can
successfully verify it. The detached signature file should be named
<samp>hw-pubkey.sig</samp> and it will be a signature for <samp>hw-pubkey.asc</samp>.</p>

<p>If you are creating a key pair on the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers,
you may exhaust its entropy pool as described in
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg/+bug/706011">Launchpad
bug 706011</a>. The symptom will be a diagnostic saying "It is a good
idea to perform some other action (type on the keyboard, move the
mouse, utilize the disks) during the prime generation; this gives the
random number generator a better chance to gain enough entropy."
Since you can't use the keyboard or mouse on the SEASnet servers,
you'll have to use the disks, for example, by using the
<samp>find</samp> command to copy every readable file to
<samp>/dev/null</samp>; this is something that you can do
in another session that is logged into the same machine.
Please remember to interrupt the <samp>find</samp> once the
key pair is generated, so that you don't tie up the server
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Briefly answer the following questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Suppose the other teams really had been observing all the bytes going
across the network in your lab exercise.
Is your resulting network still secure?  If so,
explain why, and explain whether your answer would change if (1) you
assumed the other teams had also tapped your keyboards after you completed all
client-server setup and had thereby obtained your team's keystrokes during
later operation,
or (2) you are booting off USB
and you assume the other teams temporarily had physical control of the
USB. If not, explain any weaknesses
of your team's setups, focusing on possible attacks by such outside
observers.</li>

<li>
Explain why the <samp>gpg2 --verify</samp> command in the following
instructions doesn't really verify that you personally created the
file in question. How would you go about fixing this problem?</li>

</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit the following files:</p>
<ol>
<li>The file <samp>hw-pubkey.asc</samp> as described above.</li>
<li>The file <samp>hw-pubkey.sig</samp> as described above.</li>
<li>The file <samp>log.txt</samp> which is a copy of your lab log.</li>
<li>The file <samp>hw.txt</samp>, which is a copy of your homework
log. It will contain the commands used to generate hw-pubkey.asc and
hw-pubkey.sig. Also include the answers to the two homework
questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<samp>hw.txt</samp> and <samp>log.txt</samp> should both be ASCII text files with no more
than 200 columns per line.</p>

<p>The following shell commands should work:</p>

<pre><samp>mkdir -m go-rwx .gnupg
gpg2 --homedir .gnupg --import hw-pubkey.asc
awk '200 &lt; length' log.txt hw.txt # This line should output nothing.
</samp></pre>

<p>The <samp>gpg2 --verify</samp> command should say "Good
signature". The last <samp>awk</samp> command should output
nothing.</p>
