Treating seas server 09 as the client and 07 as the server:
1. I logged in to lnxsrv09
2. Generated a key with "ssh-keygen", call it CS35L and located in ~/.ssh
3. Navigate to /.ssh to verify both public and private keys are present
4. Log out of lnxsrv09 and log in to lnxsrv07
5. After noticing that authorized_keys file does not exist in /.ssh, create with "touch authorized_keys"
   (can be skipped if already exists, it did not for me)
6. Use "cat CS35L.pub >> authorized_keys" to append the public keys to authorized_keys file
7. Log out of lnxrv07 and back into lnxsrv09
8. use "ssh -i ~/.ssh/CS35L contrera@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu" to ssh into 07 with private key
9. Enter passphrase when prompted(mine was phrase)
10. Type "exit" to go back to lnxsrv09
11. Use "eval $(ssh-agent)" to set up ssh-agent
12. Use "ssh-add ~/.ssh/CS35L" to add private key to ssh-agent
13. Use "ssh contrera@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu" to see that no password or phrase is needed.

Port Forwarding:
1. Download and set-up XMing(putty user on Windows)
2. Before entering the server, go into SSH settings, X11, and allow X11 forwarding
3. Enter lnxsrv06
4. Configure ssh-agent as described earler
5. Test xeyes in lnxrv06
6. SSH into lnxsrv01 "ssh -X contrera@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu"
7. Test xeyes now and see it still works

Multihop SSH:
1. Log in to lnxsrv06
2. Configure ssh-agent as described above
3. Use "ssh -A -t contrera@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -t contreras@lnxsrv02.seas.ucla.edu" to  "hop" from srv 06 to 01 to 02.
   (did not use ssh config file as that would take longer to learn well than theset-up with this method)
