<h2>Laboratory: Debugging a C program</h2>

<p>As usual, keep a log in the file <samp>lab5.txt</samp> of what you
do in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should
not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a
true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and
what happened.</p>

<p>You're helping to maintain an old stable version
of <samp>coreutils</samp>,
but <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz">that version</a> has a bug in
its implementation of the <samp>ls</samp> program.
(Actually, it has two bad bugs, but for now we'll just look
at the first one.)</p>

<p>The bug is that <samp>ls -t</samp> mishandles files whose time stamps are
very far in the past. It seems to act as if they are in the future.
For example:</p>

<pre><samp>$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp-wwi-armistice
$ touch /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp-now
$ sleep 1
$ touch /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp-now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp*
-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 2020-06-10 23:09:45.246353085 +0000 /run/user/5836/stamp-now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 2020-06-10 23:09:44.240314854 +0000 /run/user/5836/stamp-now
-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 /run/user/5836/stamp-wwi-armistice
$ rm /run/user/$(id -u)/stamp*
</samp></pre>

<p>Build this old version of coreutils as-is, and then again with <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff">this renaming patch</a>. What problems did you have when building it as-is, and why did the renaming patch fix them?</p>

<p>Reproduce the problem.
(Do not create the timestamp files in your home directory, as that will
tickle some bugs in the SEASnet filers and backup system.
Create them under /run/user as shown above.)
Use a debugger to figure out what went wrong and to fix the
corresponding source file.</p>

<p>Construct a new patch file <samp>lab5.diff</samp> containing your
coreutils fixes, in the form of a ChangeLog entry followed by a <samp>diff
-u</samp> patch.</p>

<p>Also, try to reproduce the problem in your home directory on the
SEASnet Linux servers, instead of using the <samp>$tmp</samp> directory.
When running the above test case, use the
already-installed <samp>touch</samp> and <samp>ls</samp> utilities
instead of the old version of coreutils. How well does SEASnet do?</p>

<h2>Homework: Sorting encrypted text</h2>

<p>The basic idea is that we want to sort obfuscated data without
deobfuscating and reobfuscating it. That is, our input is an obfuscated file, and
we could compute the output by deobfuscating the input, sorting the deobfuscated
data, and then reobfuscating the resulting output—except that we
do not want to obfuscate or deobfuscate anything.</p>

<p>Write a C function <samp>frobcmp</samp> that takes two arguments
<samp>a</samp> and <samp>b</samp> as input and returns
an <samp>int</samp> result that is negative, zero, or positive
depending on whether <samp>a</samp> is less than, equal to, or greater
than <samp>b</samp>. Each argument is of type <samp>char const
*</samp>, and each points to an array of non-space bytes that is
followed by space byte. Use standard byte-by-byte lexicographic
comparison on the non-space bytes, in the style of
the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/memcmp.html"><samp>memcmp</samp></a>
function, except that you should assume that both arrays are frobnicated,
(i.e., trivally obfuscated via
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Obfuscating-Data.html"><samp>memfrob</samp></a>)
and should return the equivalent of
running <samp>memcmp</samp> on the corresponding unfrobnicated
arrays. If one unfrobnicated array is a prefix of the other, then
consider the shorter to be less than the longer. The space bytes
are not considered to be part of either array, so they do not
participate in the comparison.</p>

<p>For example, <samp>frobcmp ("*{_CIA\030\031 ", "*`_GZY\v ")</samp>
should return a positive <samp>int</samp>
because <samp>"*{_CIA\030\031"</samp> is
<samp>"\0Quick23"</samp> frobnicated and <samp>"*`_GZY\v"</samp>
is <samp>"\0Jumps!"</samp> frobnicated, and <samp>"\0Quick23"</samp> is
greater than <samp>"\0Jumps!"</samp> in the ASCII collating sequence.
As the example demonstrates, null bytes <samp>'\0'</samp> are allowed
in the byte arrays and do contribute to the comparison.</p>

<p>Your implementation should not invoke <samp>memfrob</samp>, as that
would mean that memory would temporarily contain a copy of the
unfrobnicated data. Instead, it should look only at frobnicated bytes
one at a time, and unfrobnicate them "by hand", so to speak.</p>

<p>Use your C function to write a program <samp>sfrob</samp> that
reads frobnicated text lines from standard input, and writes a sorted version
to standard output in frobnicated form.
Frobnicated text lines consist of a series of non-space bytes followed
by a single space; the spaces represent newlines in the original text.
Your program should do all the
sorting work itself, by calling <samp>frobcmp</samp>. If standard
input ends in a partial record that does not have a trailing space,
your program should behave as if a space were appended to the
input.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdio.h.html"><samp>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</samp></a>
functions to do I/O. Use <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/malloc.html"><samp>malloc</samp></a>,
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/realloc.html"><samp>realloc</samp></a>
and <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/free.html"><samp>free</samp></a>
to allocate enough storage to hold all the input, and use <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/qsort.html"><samp>qsort</samp></a>
to sort the data.
When debugging, you may find the
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer
(asan)</a> and the
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/16/gcc-undefined-behavior-sanitizer-ubsan/">Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (ubsan)</a>
useful; these can be enabled with the GCC
options <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html"><samp>-fsanitize=address</samp> and <samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp></a>,
respectively.
</p>

<p>Do not assume that the input file is not growing:
some other process may be appending to it while you're reading, and
your program should continue to read until it reaches end of file. For
example, your program should work on the
file <samp>/proc/self/status</samp>, a "file" that is constantly
mutating: it always appears to be of size 0 when you <samp>ls</samp>
it, but it always contains nonempty contents if you read it. You
should make sure your program works on empty files, as well as on
files that are relatively large, such
as <samp>/usr/local/cs/gcc*/libexec/gcc/*/*/cc1plus</samp> on SEASnet.</p>

<p>If the program encounters an error of any kind (including
input, output or memory allocation failures, it should report the error to
<samp>stderr</samp> and exit with status 1; otherwise, the program
should succeed and exit with status 0. The program need not report
<samp>stderr</samp> output errors.</p>

<p>For example, the shell command:</p>

<pre><samp><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/printf.html">printf</a> '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' |
./sfrob |
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/od.html">od</a> -ta
</samp></pre>

<p>should output:</p>

<pre><samp>0000000   *   h   X   E   ]   D  sp   *   {   _   C   I   A  sp   *   ~
0000020   B   O  sp   *   L   E   R  sp   #   N   E   M eot  sp   #   @
0000040   _   G   Z   Y  sp   #   F   K   P   S  sp   #   E   \   O   X
0000060  sp   #   ^   B   O  sp
0000066
</samp></pre>

<p>because frobnicating <samp>sfrob</samp>'s input and then appending a trailing
newline (because the last frobnicated byte is not a newline) yields:</p>

<pre><samp>^@The
^@Quick
^@Brown
^@fox
^Ijumps
^Iover
^Ithe
^Ilazy
^Idog.
</samp></pre>

<p>where <samp>^@</samp> denotes a null byte <samp>'\0'</samp>,
and <samp>^I</samp> denotes a tab byte <samp>'\t'</samp>.
Sorting this yields:</p><p>

</p><pre><samp>^@Brown
^@Quick
^@The
^@fox
^Idog.
^Ijumps
^Ilazy
^Iover
^Ithe
</samp></pre>

<p>and frobnicating this yields the output shown above.</p>
