1. man -k printf, where printf is the word that is being searched for within the man page

2. using "which mv" I found that the mv command is located at /usr/bin/mv
   using "which sh" I found that the sh command is located at /usr/bin/sh

3. There are three programs that fit the specifications as follows, that I found using the command "find ?r":
   	 ar - used to create, modify, and extract from archives
	 pr - converts text files for printing
	 tr - translates or deletes characters

4.First I used the command "ls -l /usr/bin/emacs" to find a symbolic link
  Then, I used the command "ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs" to follow the symbolic link
  Then, "ls -l /usr/bin/emacs-24.3" to follow the symbolic link to see that this was the end of the links.
  Therefore, the file located at /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 is the actual file being executed when the emacs command is used.

5. The version of /usr/bin/gcc is 4.8.5 where as the regular gcc's version is 10.2.0. The two different programs exist 
   within the filesystem in seperate directories. The path variable dictates where in the filesystem a program is searched
   for first, leading to the regular gcc.

6. u+sx gives the user permissions to execute(x) and to set user ID on execution(s)
   o-w takes away the permission for others to write a file

7. I used the command "find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime > ~/Desktop/CS35/countMod" to get all directories and subdirectories 
   within the given path that were modified within the last 28 days and stored them all in a file called countMod.
   I then used the command "wc -l ~Desktop/CS35/countMod" to find that there were a total of 580 directories within /usr/local/cs that had been modified in the last 28 days.
   Then I used emacs to get a list of the first five directories found listed in countMod, which I will list:
   	/usr/local/cs
	/usr/local/cs/src/bash
	/usr/local/cs/src/bash/RCS
	/usr/local/cs/src/grep/
	/usr/local/cs/src/grep/RCS

8. to find out how to single out symbolic links I used: "find man"
   then to find the directory of find "which find"
   to make sure it was not a symbolic link "ls -l /usr/bin/find"
   then to single out and later count the symbolic links "find /usr/bin type -l > ~/Desktop/CS35/storesymbolic"
   "wc -l ~/Desktop/CS35/storesymbolic" to count the amount of symbolic links
   to give a total of 280 symbolic link files in the same directory as find.

9. "ls -a -t -l /usr/lib64" to see all files, sort them by time such that oldest is at bottom, and view them neatly 
   which shows us that the oldest existing file in /usr/lib64 is librom1394.so.0.3.0

10."man locale" to view the description of locale
   The description of locale states that "locale displays information based on the settings of the environment variables that control the locale"

11. In emacs:"C-h a" then "downcase RET" to find the following commands:
       downcase-dwim
       downcase-region
       downcase-word

12. In emacs:"C-h r" then "C-s" with word key repeatedly to search for the Key Index, then "C-s" to find the command corresponding to C-M-r
    C-M-r is a regular expression search backwards through a file
    C-M-s is a regular expression search forwards through a file
    C-M-S scrolls down on another buffer without having to switch to it
    C-M-SPC creates a mark that can be extended with further repeating of the command
    C-M-t switchs the positions of the previous balanced expression and the next
    C-M-u moves up in a parenthesis structure
    C-M-u (Dired) takes you up to the parent directory's header line
    C-M-v scrolls up on another buffer without having to switch to it

13.In emacs: "C-h r" then "C-s" to look for Key Index then "C-s" again to find the "C-g" command
      C-g gets out of a partially filled command and stops commands still running

14.  In emacs: "C-h r" then "C-s" to look for Key Index then "C-s" again to find the yank command
     To invoke the yank command use C-y which yanks killed text, almost like pasting cut information

15.Use "ls -l /usr/bin" in terminal and "C-x d" then input in directory/usr/bin to compare information. The main differences I see are:
       	 In emacs, a file and its symbolic link are in the same color whereas shell commads colors them differently
	 In emacs, only files with symbolic links have color while more of the files in the shell command list have color
